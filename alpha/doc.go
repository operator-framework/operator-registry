// Package alpha contains subpackages that have unstable Go APIs.
// Subpackages that achieve maturity will be deprecated and moved
// to other modules or packages within operator-registry.
//
// Presence in the alpha package should not be construed as being
// of less quality than non-alpha packages. Subpackages in the
// alpha package have the same standard for testing as all other
// packages in this repository.
